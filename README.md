# Rock-Paper-Scissors game

## Description
This is my first project, a basic Rock-Paper-Scissors game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was developed during the Supersimpledev JS tutorial, providing me with hands-on experience in web development fundamentals. The game allows users to play against the computer in a simple and intuitive interface.

## Learning Focus

Explore key topics in web development with a focus on JavaScript fundamentals:
- JavaScript Basics: Understanding essential JavaScript concepts.
- Variables: Learn how to declare and use variables to store and manipulate data dynamically.
- Booleans and If-Statement: Boolean logic and conditional statements for decision-making in your code.
- Functions: Organizing code by creating reusable functions, enhancing modularity.
- Objects: Understand the power of objects, organizing data and behaviour in a structured manner.
- Document Object Model (DOM): Gain insights into manipulating HTML and CSS dynamically, enhancing interactivity with the DOM.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Together: Explore the synergy of these three technologies, discovering how they collaborate to create dynamic and engaging web experiences.


##Features
- Play against the computer.
- Easy-to-use interface with clickable buttons.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors game

## Description
This is my first project, a basic Rock-Paper-Scissors game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was developed during the Supersimpledev JS tutorial, providing me with hands-on experience in web development fundamentals. The game allows users to play against the computer in a simple and intuitive interface.


##Features
- Play against the computer.
- Easy-to-use interface with clickable buttons.
- Real-time updates of the game results.
- Randomized computer moves for unpredictability.

## How to Play

1. Open the `10-rock-paper-scissors.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on the "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors" button to make your move.
3. The computer will randomly choose its move.
4. The game will display the result, indicating whether you win, lose, or it's a tie.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the webpage.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.
